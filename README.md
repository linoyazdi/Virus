# Virus

This virus duplicates itself to another folder (when the computer restarts it runs all the files in this folder - so restarting the computer won't solve the virus). The virus runs its replication, so if you close one the second will open it again. Meanwhile, the virus opens a hidden folder and saving there files with random characters and random content (to waste computer memory).
